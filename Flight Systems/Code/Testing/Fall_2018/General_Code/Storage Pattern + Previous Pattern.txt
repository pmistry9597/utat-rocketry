Each message of each data type will start with a delimiter of 5 bytes and immediately following a
character specific to that message followed by the actual message itself. 
No spacing or terminators needed for messages as the message size length will be constant for each data type.
Time for readings will be given by a time stamp message for each sensor. The readings of the sensor will be first printed
and then the time reading message will follow.

	Previous: acceleration given by 3 components together in a string. all messages have a timestamp before.

Float and long data will be 4 bytes in size.

Ex. message for acceleration y component

[delimiter]Y[accel y]

Delimiter (individual byte values given):
255 0 255 100 50

MS5611 Pressure Sensor Data:
P - pressure
T - temperature

U - pressure time
V - temperature time

IMU Data:
A - acceleration x
B - acceleration y
C - acceleration z

M - magnetic field x
N - magnetic field y
O - magnetic field z

G - gyro x
H - gyro y
I - gyro z

J - IMU time

	Previous:
	A - acceleration (has 3 axis)
	M - magnetic field (has 3 axis)
	G - gyro (has 3 axis)

GPS Data:
K - latitude - positive means north
L - longitude - positive means west

R - universal time (given by gps)

Y - altitude

Z - GPS GGA string time reading (relevant to K, L, U, Y, gps fields)

	Previous:
	L - location data (latitude - positive means north, longitude - positive means west)
	U - universal time (hours minutes seconds)
	H - altitude
	(will not be used due to problems with showing speed and track made good) R - ground velocity (track made good - relative to true north, speed)

Stratologger Data:
W - altitude
X - stratologger record time
